# reg_lattice_comp

Implementing algorithms for numerical and graphical computation of  neighborhood lattices in `R`, as detailed in the paper ["Partial correlation graphs and the neighborhood lattice"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00991).

See [lattice_tests.pdf](R_code/lattice_tests.pdf) for examples of how the code might be used.
